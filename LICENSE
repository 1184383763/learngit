All adults were once children, but only a few remember
To me,you are still nothing more than a little boy who is juest like a hundred other little boys.I don't need you.You don't need me.To you, I am just a fox,no different from thousands of other foxes.But if you tame me,we'll need each other.To me,you are the only one like you in my world.I'm the only one in your world for you.
